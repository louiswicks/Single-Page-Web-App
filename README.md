1. As a programmer
   I can see a list of my notes, where each note is abbreviated to the first 20 characters
   So I can find the one I want

2. As a programmer
   I can create a new note
   So I can record something I need to remember

3. As a programmer
   I can see the full text of an individual note on its own page
   So I can see all the information in the note

4. As a programmer
   I can use shortcodes like `:fire:` that get converted into emojis like ðŸ”¥
   So I can record notes with fun little pictures

General Action Plan:

* Test the construction of an array

* List the elements of the array
- Abbreviate the notes to the first 20 characters (want some type of link to full note)

* Create a new element
* Add a new element to the array

* Record emojis with 'fun little pictures'
- When abbreviated characters are clicked on the full note is displayed below
